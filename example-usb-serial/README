TODO:
* serial config setting
  * CTSRTS? How by USB? By vendor specific control?
* stats report control
  * USB communication class interface notification (interrupt ENDP2) support
    SERIAL_STATE
* SEND_BREAK support
* Use of DMA for serial communication
* RS-232 support: GPIO with DTR (out), DCD (in), DSR (in), RI (in)
* Half-duplex support
* Support of other communication mode: smartcard, IrDA, etc.
